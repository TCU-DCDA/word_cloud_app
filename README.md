# Real-Time Word Cloud for Student Feelings

A web application designed to collect and visualize student feelings about starting their coding journey on the first day of an intro coding class. Students submit short paragraphs about their feelings, and the app generates a beautiful, real-time word cloud that updates as responses come in.

## üöÄ Live Demo

**Visit the live application:** [https://tcu-dcda.github.io/word_cloud_app/](https://tcu-dcda.github.io/word_cloud_app/)

## üé® Customization

### Word Cloud Appearance
Edit the `WORDCLOUD_OPTIONS` in `script.js`:
- Colors: Modify the `color` function

## üè´ Classroom Tips

1. **Pre-class Setup**: Test the URL and ensure it works on your classroom computer
2. **Clear Instructions**: Show students the character limit and encourage honest, thoughtful responses
3. **Privacy**: Remind students that responses are anonymous but visible to the class
4. **Discussion Starter**: Use the final word cloud as a springboard for discussion about coding expectations and feelings
5. **Screenshots**: Capture the final word cloud for future reference or class materials

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### App shows "Demo mode" message
- This is normal! The app is configured to run with sample data
- Students can still submit responses and see them added to the word cloud
- To connect to Google Sheets, follow the "Google Sheets Integration" steps above

### Word cloud not updating
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Verify the browser supports modern JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Form submissions not working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

## üìä Demo Data

The app includes 8 realistic sample responses about starting a coding journey:
- Responses range from excited to nervous to overwhelmed
- Demonstrates various emotions and attitudes toward learning to code
- Shows how the word cloud emphasizes key themes like "excited", "learning", "challenging", and "creative"
